/**
 * A {@link Renderer} that uses a coarse-to-fine rendering scheme. First, a small {@link ArrayImg} at a fraction of
 * the canvas resolution is rendered. Then, increasingly larger images are rendered, until the full canvas resolution is
 * reached.
 * <p>
 * When drawing the low-resolution {@link ArrayImg} to the screen, they will be scaled up by Java2D to the full canvas
 * size, which is relatively fast. Rendering the small, low-resolution images is usually very fast, such that the
 * display is very interactive while the user changes the viewing transformation for example. When the transformation
 * remains fixed for a longer period, higher-resolution details are filled in successively.
 * <p>
 * The renderer allocates a {@link ArrayImg} for each of a predefined set of
 * <em>screen scales</em> (a screen scale of 1 means that 1 pixel in the screen
 * image is displayed as 1 pixel on the canvas, a screen scale of 0.5 means 1 pixel in the screen image is displayed as
 * 2 pixel on the canvas, etc.)
 * <p>
 * At any time, one of these screen scales is selected as the <em>highest screen scale</em>. Rendering starts with this
 * highest screen scale and then proceeds to lower screen scales (higher resolution images). Unless the highest screen
 * scale is currently rendering, {@link #requestRepaint(Interval) repaint request} will cancel rendering, such that display
 * remains interactive.
 * <p>
 * The renderer tries to maintain a per-frame rendering time close to a desired number of <code>targetRenderNanos</code>
 * nanoseconds. If the rendering time (in nanoseconds) for the (currently) highest scaled screen image is above this
 * threshold, a coarser screen scale is chosen as the highest screen scale to use. Similarly, if the rendering time for
 * the (currently) second-highest scaled screen image is below this threshold, this finer screen scale chosen as the
 * highest screen scale to use.
 * <p>
 * The renderer uses multiple threads (if desired) and double-buffering (if desired).
 * <p>
 * Double buffering means that three {@link ArrayImg BufferedImages} are created for every screen scale. After
 * rendering the first one of them and setting it to the {@link RenderTarget}, next time, rendering goes to the second
 * one, then to the third. The {@link RenderTarget} will always have a complete image, which is not rendered to while it
 * is potentially drawn to the screen. When setting an image to the {@link RenderTarget}, the {@link RenderTarget} will
 * release one of the previously set images to be rendered again. Thus, rendering will not interfere with painting the
 * {@link ArrayImg} to the canvas.
 * <p>
 * The renderer supports rendering of {@link Volatile} sources. In each rendering pass, all currently valid data for the
 * best fitting mipmap level and all coarser levels is rendered to a {@link #renderImages temporary image} for each
 * visible source. Then the temporary images are combined to the final image for display. The number of passes required
 * until all data is valid might differ between visible sources.
 * <p>
 * Rendering timing is tied to a {@link CacheControl} control for IO budgeting, etc.
